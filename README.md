# Reverse Polish Calculator (ICL Coursework)

Created a GUI where users can press buttons to input numbers for a Reverse Polish Calculator 

(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) 

Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation wherein every operator follows all of its 
operands. For example, if we want to add 3 and 4, we write 3 4 +

So this Reverse Polish Calculator allows the user to click 3 (and we see 3 in the input display), then 4 
(and we see 4), and then +, which performs the calculation and shows the result 7 on the output display.

This app is made using a Model-View-Controller design pattern. The model section implements a java.util.Stack
for the calculations.
